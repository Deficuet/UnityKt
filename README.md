# UnityKt
A read-only Unity assets extractor for Kotlin based on [AssetStudio](https://github.com/Perfare/AssetStudio) and refer to [UnityPy](https://github.com/K0lb3/UnityPy).

All the C++ code used to decode texture compression comes from [AssetStudio/Texture2DDecoderNative](https://github.com/Perfare/AssetStudio/tree/master/Texture2DDecoderNative).

For the attempt of implementing the algorithum of decoding ETC2_RGB8A texture compression for Java, see [ETC2_RGB8ADecoderForJava](https://github.com/Deficuet/ETC2_RGBA8DecoderForJava)
